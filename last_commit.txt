üìÖ Last Development Session - 28 October 2025

üöÄ NEW FEATURES ADDED:

1. **Path Planner Integration in UAV Controller**
   - Added neighbors_info_subscription_ for swarm communication
   - Implemented path_planner_callback() function
   - Integrated CalculateCenterofGravity and CalculateOffsetsFromCenter
   - Added automatic formation planning based on neighbor positions

2. **Enhanced CalculateOffsetsFromCenter Class**
   - Fixed template issues and member variable problems
   - Added proper circular formation calculation
   - Optimized with offsets.reserve() for better performance
   - Implemented index-based offset multiplication for distributed formation
   - Thread-safe implementation with local variables only

üîß TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- **Memory Management**: All classes now use RAII pattern
- **Performance**: Vector pre-allocation with reserve()
- **Safety**: Exception handling for empty position lists
- **Code Quality**: Removed problematic member variables
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: Proper GPS coordinate conversion

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE UPDATES:

- UAV Controller now has full path planning capabilities
- Swarm formation logic integrated into main control loop
- Center of gravity calculation for optimal formation positioning
- Offset calculation for distributed drone positioning

üìù NEXT STEPS:
- Implement drone-to-offset assignment algorithm
- Add formation type selection (circular, linear, etc.)
- Integrate with flight control commands
